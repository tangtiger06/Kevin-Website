        <p>     Some of my favorite subjects  in school are math, science, and social studies.
            Some of my hobbies are playing basketball , eating snacks , running around or walking, and gaming .
            My favorite sports  are Basketball and Football but I also play soccer, ping pong and do some swimming. I also play Ping pong
            with my dad from time to time.Instrumentsthat I can play are the Piano, Violin, and Recorder. I learned to play the piano in kindergarten or first grade,
            and I learned Violin in 3rd grade or 2nd grade, and I learned Recorder in 5th grade.
            The instrument that I think is the easiest is probably the piano since I just have to read the notes
            then play the keys and the instrument that I think is the hardest is the Violin since you have to get your finger in the perfect position
            and play smoothly or else it will sound squeaky and loud. The one that I play the most though is the Violin
            since my elective in middle school is orchestra.
